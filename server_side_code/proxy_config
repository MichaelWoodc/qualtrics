###  This is a more permissive example, and this may be able to be modified to be more secure.  I don't recommend using it as is.  
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS";
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept";


### Going to try something more restrictive soon: (untested as of today)

# Only allow requests from the Qualtrics survey domain
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://georgiasouthern.co1.qualtrics.com";

# Only allow POST (for data submission) and OPTIONS (for preflight checks)
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "POST, OPTIONS";

# Only allow Content-Type header (needed for JSON/form submissions)
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type";
